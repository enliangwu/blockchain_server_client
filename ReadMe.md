# BlockChain Project

This project inlude a Block class, a BlockChain class, and a distributed system where a remote client interacts with a blockchain API.

The interaction between the client and the server will be with JSON messages over TCP sockets.
Real blockchains are decentralized and include peer to peer communication and many replicas of the blockchain. 
The blocks themselves typically include Merkle Trees. 
This project does not do all of that but it does provide a foundation to build on.
Note that the Javadoc describes writing "data" or a "transaction" to the blockchain. 
In this project, our "data" or "transaction" will be simple statements transferring "dscoin" from one player to another.
